# React TypeScript Todo App

## About this Repository

This app was created during the React TypeScript Todo App tutorial (link forthcoming). I recommend following along with the tutorial video, but feel free to clone this app directly and explore the code!

Clone the app:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nas5w/react-typescript-todo-app.git

## Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
